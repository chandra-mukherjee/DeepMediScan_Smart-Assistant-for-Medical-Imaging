user queries using Meta’s LLaMA models via GROQ API, built with FastAPI and a responsive Tailwind-based frontend.


## Key Features:


a)Image Upload Functionality: Users can easily upload clinical images for analysis.

b)Interactive Query System: Users can ask natural language questions related to the uploaded image.

c)AI-Powered Medical Responses: The app uses two versions of the LLaMA (Meta's LLM) model to provide dual AI responses for better clarity and comparison.

d)Modern UI/UX: Developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for a sleek and responsive design.

e)Backend with FastAPI:Handles image and query processing, model communication, and error handling.
f)Secure API Integration:Utilizes GROQ’s LLaMA models with secure API key management via .env.


## Use Case:


Ideal for clinical environments or healthcare apps that require quick preliminary analysis from image-based medical data 
with AI support — such as for radiologists, students, or remote diagnostics.

1)Chicken Pox- 
It started with me feeling tired and a bit feverish, like I was coming down with something mild. Then, small red spots began to appear on my chest and back. They quickly turned into itchy blisters filled with fluid. Now, the rash is spreading to my face, arms, and legs, and the itching is getting worse.
2)Dandruf - 
I've been experiencing an itchy scalp with visible dandruff for the past few weeks. There are red patches that seem to be getting worse, and my scalp feels irritated and sore at times.
